Just as they championed privacy, we champion education. We believe that knowledge is the foundation of freedom and change.\n\nWe are Bitcoin-only. \n\nWe advocate for individual responsibility and the independence offered by owning your own keys. \n\nWe urge verification, not blind trust. \n\nWe believe that by fixing the money, we fix the world.\n\nWe are decentralized and open-source, avoiding any single point of failure. \n\nWe encourage the free dissemination of our content. \n\nWe aspire to a world that operates from the bottom up, where the individual is at the center.\n\nWe are DB.
